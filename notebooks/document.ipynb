    "### What is a Random Walk?\n",
    "\n",
    "A random walk is a sequence of nodes where each step moves to a **random neighbor**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Start at node A\n",
    "    → randomly pick neighbor B\n",
    "    → randomly pick neighbor of B → C\n",
    "    → randomly pick neighbor of C → D\n",
    "    → ... continue for L steps\n",
    "    \n",
    "Result: Walk = [A, B, C, D, ...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Random Walks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random walks capture **structural proximity**:\n",
    "- Nodes appearing together in walks are **structurally close**\n",
    "- The more often two nodes co-occur, the more similar they are\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Key Insight (from Node2Vec/DeepWalk)\n",
    "\n",
    "Treat walks like **sentences** and nodes like **words**:\n",
    "- Word2Vec: Words appearing in same context are similar\n",
    "- Node2Vec: Nodes appearing in same walk are similar\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we use **skip-gram loss** - same objective as Word2Vec!"
